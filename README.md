## Project Initialization

1. Clone the repository

2. Use Java JDK 11

3. Ensure gretty is 3.0.6 not 3.0.4
4. Follow the remainder of the instructions in the README.md

## GitHub Repository & Git Workflow (15%)

For our github workflow, we created rules to ensure branch protections. Those rules include not allowing collaborators to commit changes directly to main and requiring a reviewer for each pull request.

## Containerization (20%)

### Background/Development/Usage

Below is the process taken to containerize the application:

1. Created a Dockerfile
2. Built the Docker image using `docker build --tag 'ensf400-g20' .`
3. Run the Docker image using `docker run -it -p 8080:8080 ensf400-g20`
4. An alternative way to run the Dockerfile: Run `docker compose up` to start the application and keep it running.
5. Access the application at `http://localhost:8080/demo`

### Dockerfile

The Dockerfile can be found [here](./Dockerfile)
As seen in the Dockerfile, we had to use the same versioning requirements that were needed to run the application locally. This meant using an exact gradle image with the correct version of gradle and java JDK. Afterwards the Dockerfile copies the project directory into the container and then runs the application using gradle instead of the gradle wrapper provided in the project.

### Docker Compose

The Docker Compose file can be found [here](./docker-compose.yml), this helps ensure that the containerization procedure will scale moving forward with the project. Additionally, we used the docker-compose.yml to ensure that the application did not immediately exit after starting up.

### Docker Image on Docker Hub

Our docker image can be found in a repository on docker hub [here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/mattmcdou/ci-cd-pipeline-automation-app/tags/latest/sha256-cedc83a81df4c45f3a1312ecd1c3a48de0c5cf1e51c645d8446d645863fcfaca).

use the following command to pull the image:

```bash
docker pull mattmcdou/ci-cd-pipeline-automation-app:latest
```

use the following command to run the container, and keep it open:

```bash
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 mattmcdou/ci-cd-pipeline-automation-app:latest
```
